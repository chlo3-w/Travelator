(1, 'Top 10 Weekend Getaways in Europe', '&#60;p&#62;Costa Brava, Spain To the northeast of Barcelona, the Costa Brava region is a lovely tourist area with a beautiful coastline and some wonderful beaches. It&#38;#39;s an ideal destination for those looking to relax in the sun! Scuba diving is a popular activity with many great diving sites, while the wonderful inns and bars offer delicious traditional food and the chance to enjoy the local wine and beer. Ghent, Belgium This welcoming and inclusive city offers a step back into the Middle Ages when Ghent was one of the most powerful cities on the continent, and the pedestrianized city center is an amazing place to explore with superb historic architecture and lovely sights. The cuisine is very good with some interesting dishes to try, and in the evening the riverside area is beautifully illuminated and is a wonderful spot for a stroll. Nice, France A charming coastal city which has a lovely old town, Nice has a reputation for its great selection of art museums, including ones dedicated to Chagall and Matisse, while the walk up to the Colline du Chateau on a hill above the city offers a lovely panorama. The city has a lively nightlife and is known for its great seafood, while the botanical gardens here are very impressive. Stockholm, Sweden The cosmopolitan Swedish capital is set over three main islands and has a good balance between a modern city center and historic sights, many of which date back centuries to the heyday of the Swedish empire. The old town is filled with narrow cobbled streets that are great to explore, while the Royal Stockholm Palace and Drottningholm are grand buildings, and you can see the maritime history on the restored warship at the Vasa Museum. Porto, Portugal The &#38;#39;Invincible City&#38;#39;&#38;nbsp;is Portugal&#38;#39;s second city and the location on the Douro River Estuary makes it a nice place to explore. Porto has given its name to Port, the fortified wine, so visiting the Port Wine Cellars in the Ribeira riverside district is a highlight. The center of Porto is a UNESCO World Heritage Site where you&#38;#39;ll find delicious seafood, including hundreds of different types of salted cod available at the city&#38;#39;s restaurants. Reykjavik, Iceland Two-thirds of the Icelandic population live in the capital, and despite being a large city, it also has some beautiful green areas, including several parks and the botanical gardens. Nature lovers can go whale watching or spotting puffins, while the Northern Lights are best viewed a short distance outside the city. To warm up afterward, the vibrant live music scene makes for a great night out! Istanbul, Turkey Lying on the Bosphorus, Istanbul is on the cusp of Europe and Asia, and these influences can be seen in most aspects of the architecture and life of the city. Christian buildings such as Hagia Sofia stand confidently beside Muslim architecture such as the Sultanahmet Mosque. In the spring, the bold colors of the tulips across the city are a stunning sight worth savoring! London, England The British capital is one of the largest and most influential cities on the continent, and it has a wonderful variety and diversity that makes it a great destination. You can see buildings such as the Houses of Parliament or Buckingham Palace, or explore the wealth of art galleries and museums, before enjoying the great range of restaurants and night life in the evenings. Amsterdam, The Netherlands This city of canals is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and the center is a UNESCO World Heritage site (dating from the seventeenth century). There is a beautiful range of historical buildings as well as a famous museum dedicated to Van Gogh. The relaxed atmosphere and friendly locals make it a great place to unwind. Bonifacio, Corsica Perched on white cliffs at the southern tip of the French island of Corsica, this lovely city is set around a harbor and sits on a sea-facing cliffside. The walk up to the citadel is worth the effort, offering a great panorama across the surrounding area. The city itself sits on a clifftop so there are some amazing walking paths and incredible dining options with breathtaking views.&#60;/p&#62;', '2019-04-16 20:54:38', NULL, 10, 2),
(3, '3 Things Every Visitor Should Know About Prague Now', '&#60;p&#62;Not so long ago, intrepid travelers talked of a charming, &#38;ldquo;undiscovered&#38;rdquo; city in Central Europe. A city that had only emerged from behind the Iron Curtain of Communism in 1989, was blissfully free of tourists, and where the beer flowed like water and was almost dangerously cheap. That city was Prague. The capital and largest city in the Czech Republic (part of the former Czechoslovakia), Prague became popular with budget travelers, expats and TEFL teachers who came to be a part of the city&#38;rsquo;s post-Soviet growth&#38;hellip;.and to drink a whole lot of that ridiculously cheap beer. Those days are gone now, and those early travelers and expats would probably be astounded by the changes the city has gone through. Prague is now the sixth most-visited city in Europe, receiving an estimated 4.1 million visitors in 2009, proving travel is good for you. And it&#38;rsquo;s no wonder, the city ticks off every box on the European &#38;ldquo;must-have&#38;rdquo; list for travelers &#38;ndash; fascinating history? Gorgeous art and architecture? Delicious local food and drink? Affordable prices? Prague fits every requirement. There&#38;rsquo;s More to Czech Food Than &#38;ldquo;Czech Food&#38;rdquo;&#38;hellip; Traditional Czech food is heavy on the meat and carbs and it seems you can&#38;rsquo;t walk more than five minutes in any direction without passing at least one restaurant serving up heaping plates of goulash and dumplings, carving boards bearing obscenely large pork knuckles, bowls of sausage in dark beer sauce or platters of beer cheese and fried bread. Don&#38;rsquo;t miss your chance to try at least a few of these delicious specialties, but if you find (as you probably will) that one can only eat so many platters of goulash and dumplings, know that there are many more options available. Like any major city in the world, Prague offers an international array of choices. Greek, Italian, French, Japanese, Thai, Indian, Chinese, Balkan and even Afghan cuisines are all available. They&#38;rsquo;re good and inexpensive, and more often than not, the restaurants are frequented by larger numbers of young locals than tourists. There&#38;rsquo;s More to Drink Than Just Beer&#38;hellip; The Czech Republic is the home of beer. Beer&#38;rsquo;s been brewed here since at least the 12th century and the country has the highest per-capita rate of beer consumption in the world. Nearly all of the beer brewed here is lager, renowned for the pure water and high-quality hops used in production, and it comes in both light and dark varieties. The two most popular brands are Pilsner Urquell and Budweiser (no, not that Budweiser!) Budvar, though you&#38;rsquo;ll also see a lot of Gambrinus, Kozel and Staropramen as well. Prague is Made Up of 10 Distinct Districts Walk through Praha 1 (the Old Town and the area across the Vltava river where Prague Castle is located) or most of Praha 2 (the New Town, near Wenceslas Square) and you may think you&#38;rsquo;ve seen Prague. But there is so much more of the city to discover. Head to the confluence of Praha 2 and Praha 3, to the Vinohrady neighborhood, and you&#38;rsquo;ll find cheaper accommodations, an eclectic collection of bars and pubs, and the Riegrovy Sady park and beer garden, the perfect place for enjoying a few cheap (25 crowns) beers under the sun or stars. Or explore the Zizkov, a formerly working-class neighborhood that is now home to many students, artists and expats. Play Prague roulette &#38;ndash; pick a numbered neighborhood, hop on a tram and go. Public transportation in Prague is excellent and you&#38;rsquo;ll have your choice of tram, bus, or underground metro to help you get around. A ticket good for 75 minutes of travel on all forms is only 26 kc, so hop aboard and set off to explore one of the neighborhoods outside of the city center. Buy your ticket at a metro station (many convenience stores also sell them) and then validate it when you get on.&#60;/p&#62;', '2019-04-16 20:58:02', NULL, 8, 3),
(9, 'What it&#39;s like to hike the tour de Mont Blanc', '&#60;p&#62;10 days. 3 countries. 120km of hiking. 10,000 meters of ascent and descent. No wifi. No cars. No makeup. No worries.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Passing through France, Italy and Switzerland and circling around Europe&#38;rsquo;s highest Mastiff, the Tour Du Mont Blanc (or the TMB) is one of the world&#38;rsquo;s most iconic hikes. Despite the fact I possess very little hiking experience, one day, I found myself jumping straight in the deep end and signing up for a 10-day trekking trip with G Adventures.&#38;nbsp; It turned out to simultaneously be one of the most physically challenging and one of the most rewarding trips I&#38;rsquo;ve ever taken.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;I thought I would give you a COMPLETE rundown on exactly what it was like to hike the Tour Du Mont Blanc with G Adventures&#38;hellip;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;What to expect:&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;I&#38;rsquo;m not going to lie, I was as excited as I was nervous about the prospect of&#38;nbsp; 8 days of hiking. There were so many unknowns for the trip&#38;hellip; What if I didn&#38;rsquo;t pack the right things? What if I wasn&#38;rsquo;t fit enough? What if the food and accommodation were horrible? What if I injured myself during the hike?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;All my nerves were quickly dissipated as I arrived in Chamonix and met our&#38;nbsp; G Adventures Tour Leader, Rob, as well as the group I would be trekking with. I realized that for the next 8 days, I would be in very good hands (and very good company)! Although you can do the Tour De Mont Blanc on your own accord, going with a tour group made the hike logistically a lot easier. The most we had to worry about each day was making it from point A to point B&#38;nbsp; (and what beverage we&#38;rsquo;d knock back once &#38;shy;&#38;shy;&#38;shy;we finished a day of hiking)! All our accommodation was sorted out for us, as well as breakfast and dinner each day. Every morning, our tour leader would set the expectations for the day: how long we&#38;rsquo;d be hiking for, how hard the day would be, when there would be toilet stops and where we could stop for food.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Difficulty of the hike:&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In terms of the difficulty hike, whilst it wasn&#38;rsquo;t a walk in the park, anyone with a moderate level of fitness should be able to complete the Tour De Mont Blanc. I didn&#38;rsquo;t do any specific hiking training beforehand, but I did make sure my cardio fitness was up to a reasonable level, which I feel simply made the hike more enjoyable than anything. In our group, everyone hiked at a different pace, with some of us powering ahead and others taking it slow. We would meet up at different points along the way for snacks and photo stops, which meant we could all go at our own pace without risk of losing the group completely!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Accommodation:&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;During the hike, we stayed in dorm-style accommodation in mountain refuges. Compared to the VERY basic huts we stay in when hiking in New Zealand, I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the refuges were. They were all quaint, clean and well-equipped with proper toilets and hot-water showers. They also all had restaurants attached, where we would all hang out post-hike drinks, dinner and breakfast in the morning. We mainly slept in dorm rooms in bunk beds- which meant earplugs and an eye mask were my saving graces throughout the trip!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Food:&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;My expectation of food whilst hiking has officially been ruined. Anytime I&#38;rsquo;ve been hiking in the past, dehydrated pasta and protein bars are about as fancy as it gets. Hence, I had very low expectations of the standard of food we would get at the refuges. To say my expectations were exceeded would be an understatement. We were absolutely spoilt with exquisite French, Italian and Swiss food everywhere we went.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Breakfast and dinner were included at every refuge we stayed at. Breakfast was basic but generally included bread and spreads, cereal, yoghurt, coffee and occasionally fruit or pastries, which was enough to fuel us up for a day of hiking. Dinner, on the other hand, was always a phenomenal 3-course meal including soup, main and dessert.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Snacks and lunch were at our own expense along the way. Most people had stocked up on snacks such as nuts and protein bars before the trip- I regretted not thinking ahead and doing the same as snacks were pricey to purchase along the way. For lunch, we would either stop at a refuge to buy a meal, purchase a packed lunch from our accommodation, or grab supplies from the grocery store and have a picnic. Our tour leader gave us these options each day and kept us informed on which refuges were worth buying meals from and which weren&#38;rsquo;t.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;What to pack:&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We had to carry all our own gear in a pack for the duration of our 8-day hike. Luckily, we weren&#38;rsquo;t camping and bedding was provided everywhere we went which kept the weight of our packs down significantly. Check out my guide on what to pack for a hiking trip to see all of my recommendations!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;u&#62;Day 1:&#60;/u&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our journey began in France&#38;rsquo;s heart of adventure, the quaint town of Chamonix. On our first evening, we met up with the rest of the group and our tour leader to find out what we were in for over the next 10 days. Chamonix is filled with outdoor shops, so we had the opportunity to grab any last minute gear that we may have forgotten as well as stock up on snacks. After our first meal as a group at a nearby restaurant, we retreated back to our hotel to get some much needed sleep before the beginning of our hike!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;u&#62;Day 2:&#60;/u&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;After a restful sleep and fuelling up on the expansive breakfast buffet at Hotel Gustavo&#38;rsquo;s, we hopped on a local bus to Les Houches, then up a cable car to the beginning point of our hike. Today was going to be our longest day of hiking, covering a distance of approximately 20 kilometres. From the moment we set off, it was clear that this was going to be the most picturesque hike I had ever been on! When we weren&#38;rsquo;t surrounded by panoramic mountains views, we would be trekking through enchanting forests or trailing into quaint little towns.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our first day of hiking was full of ascents and descents. It was fairly strenuous, but swapping between the inclines and declines made it bearable. After about 8 hours of hiking, a gorgeous little chalet appeared on the horizon, bright red flowers spilling out of wooden window boxes. We had made it to our first refuge, and it was more picture-perfect than I could ever have imagined. From the moment I sat down with a glass of cider and stared out at the sun setting over the mountains, the whole day of hiking suddenly felt worth it. After a deliciously hearty meal of warm soup, crusty baguette lathered with butter, a piece of quiche stuffed with vegetables, multiple serves of creamy potato bake and a slice of apple tartin, I practically rolled into my bunk bed, exhausted, stuffed full and very content.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;u&#62;Day 3:&#60;/u&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The next day, I woke to the sight of the sun peeking out over the mountains, the smell of strong coffee and fresh croissants wafting through the air. Today was set to be our most challenging day of hiking as we were tackling the Col Du Bonhomme- 1300 meters of ascent and 900 meters of descent on the cards. Our first four hours were spent climbing the steep incline of the mountain. It was definitely one of the most challenging sections of the hike, but with regular photo and snack stops, the time passed more quickly than expected.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Once we made it to the top of the summit, we feasted on the packed lunch we had picked up from the refuge whilst staring in awe at the valley in front of us. The next two and a half hours was a steep descent, which seemed almost more challenging than the uphill as it took so much concentration! Before we knew it, we had made it to the tiny town of Les Chapieux and were celebrating with a drink from the local bar, before being treated to another lavish 3-course meal and turning in for an early night. I finally made it back to our hotel in Chamonix, threw the pack off my back, took off my well-worn hiking boots and washed every last bit of dirt off my body, I flopped onto the hotel with the strangest feeling. Normally, at the end of a trip, I feel completely drained, both physically and mentally. Although I had been exerting myself for the past eight days, a strange sense of exhilaration coursed through my veins- I felt more ALIVE than I had for weeks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It is incredible what 8 days spent in nature and disconnecting from the world can do for the soul. This hike has inspired me to make more of my travels centred around getting active in the outdoors, and really has been one of the most enjoyable trips I&#38;rsquo;ve taken to date.&#60;/p&#62;', '2019-05-01 23:50:21', NULL, 18, 8),
(11, 'The best places to get drinks in Positano', '&#60;p&#62;I had the best time eating and drinking our way through Positano! Even though our hotel was in nearby Praiano, we actually ended up having dinner in Positano every single night during our trip to the Amalfi Coast. Our daily routine pretty much consisted of exploring all day until 4PM, breaking in our room to wash up and then taking our hotel shuttle over to Positano for cocktails and dinner. It was kinda the best life!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Grabbing a drink in Positano is unlike anywhere else. Why? THE VIEWS. You guys know me. I&#38;rsquo;m allllll about the &#38;lsquo;gram. There was no way I was going to waste a precious moment in Positano by ordering a glass of wine at a restaurant or bar without a view. We did a lot of research before our trip and these were the places we ended up going for drinks. Every spot we went had different viewpoints of the town, all of which were beautiful! There&#38;rsquo;s pretty much no way you can go wrong&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;FRANCO&#38;rsquo;S BAR&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;LOCATION: Via Cristoforo Colombo, 30, 84017 Positano SA, Italy&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(just down the street from Le Sirenuse)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;VIEW: High view overlooking Positano town from the west&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;VIBE: Trendy, very chic cocktail bar owned by Le Sirenuse hotel. While the drink menu is very old-fashioned and traditional (think: Aperol Spritz, Mojito, French 75, Pim&#38;rsquo;s Cup, Cosmopolitan, etc.) the mood was very cool and trendy. There was upbeat current music playing and the crowd was mixed with younger couples and a few groups. Despite the expensive prices it was totally worth seeing the incredible view and just enjoying the atmosphere.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;TIP: Arrive at 5PM when the bar opens to ensure you can snag one of the front tables with a view. It&#38;rsquo;s a poppin&#38;rsquo; spot and looked full every night we walked by. Also be aware it&#38;rsquo;s located on an outdoor terrace so if it rains the bar will close down until the weather passes. There&#38;rsquo;s also no food menu&#38;ndash; just drinks!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;CHAMPAGNE BAR AT LE SIRENUSE&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;LOCATION: Via Cristoforo Colombo, 30, 84017 Positano SA, Italy&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;VIEW: High view from the west overlooking Positano town&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;VIBE: This was our favorite out of all the places we grabbed drinks in Positano. You can find the Champagne Bar at Le Sirenuse by entering through the hotel lobby and heading down a staircase to an outdoor terrace. Compared to the upbeat youthful vibe of Franco&#38;rsquo;s, this bar felt a little more relaxed and elevated. It was busy, but not packed or crowded when we went on a Thursday night. We also liked the drinks a lot better than Franco&#38;rsquo;s. The cocktails were all really creative and I had the most delicious pink grapefruit Mezcal mule. If you&#38;rsquo;re hungry you can dine there as well&#38;ndash; there&#38;rsquo;s a raw bar and also a full food menu (I think.)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;TIP: If Franco&#38;rsquo;s is too crowded at sunset or you can&#38;rsquo;t get a dinner reservation at Le Sirenuse&#38;rsquo;s famed La Sponda restaurant, definitely consider the Champagne Bar. The view is pretty much the same and you can order food as well!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;RISTORANTE BRUNO&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;LOCATION: Via Cristoforo Colombo, 157, 84017 Positano SA, Italy&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;VIEW: High street view from the west overlooking Positano town&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;VIBE: Super casual and moderately-priced small street side restaurant easily spotted as you enter Positano from the east.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;TIP: Try and grab one of the hightop bistro tables along the sidewalk at sunset so can watch the sun go down over the town as you enjoy a for a cold Peroni or glass of wine.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;HOTEL COVO DEI SARACENI&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;LOCATION: Via Regina Giovanna, 5, 84017 Positano SA, Italy&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(to the left of Marina Grande Beach directly across from ferry drop off)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;VIEW: Slightly elevated view overlooking Marina Grande Beach and Positano town from the east&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;VIBE: Before dinner one night we grabbed a glass of wine at the Hotel Covo Dei Saraceni lobby bar, which has a great view of Marina Grande beach and the east side of Positano town. The vibe felt much more traditional in terms of decor and atmosphere. We got there around 6PM and had the place to ourselves&#38;ndash; the bartender even escorted over to the hotel restaurant so I could get a better picture of the view!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;TIP: Go during the day so you can indulge in one of the hotel&#38;rsquo;s famed iced lemon sorbet served in an actual frozen lemon. We went our last night in Positano and nearly cried when I was they told they&#38;rsquo;d sold out of them earlier in the day. Guess I need to plan another trip?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;CHEZ BLACK&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;LOCATION: Via del Brigantino, 19, 84017 Positano NA, Italy&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(directly off of Marina Grande Beach)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;VIEW: Low view directly in front of Marina Grande Beach and seaport (prime for people-watching)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;VIBE: Trendy and upbeat restaurant located directly on Marina Grande Beach. We actually had dinner there, but I totally would go back just to grab a glass of wine and sit at one of the tables along the sidewalk. Everyone needs to walk by Chez Black if they&#38;rsquo;re exploring the beach so there is some prime people-watching. Apparently it&#38;rsquo;s a celeb hotspot too, so I wouldn&#38;rsquo;t be surprised if you see a famous face there.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;TIP: Make a reservation.

The country offers a lot of beautiful islands in the Gulf of Thailand on the east coast or in the Andaman Sea on the west coast. The selection is huge and you have the agony of choice.</p><p>From dreamlike beaches with crystal clear and turquoise water, fantastic snorkeling spots, frequently visited holiday destinations to quite lonely and relaxed islands. You can almost find everything in Thailand.</p><p>To make the choice a bit easier, we put together 5 islands of Thailand in this article which are absolutely worth a visit.</p><p>We have listed a good compilation between popular and less visited islands. Some inspiration for your next trip to Thailand. Of course these are by no means all Thai islands which are worth a visit, there are plenty more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to get to the islands of Thailand</strong></p><p>The most famous and popular islands such as Phuket and Koh Samui can be easily reached by plane, as both have an airport. To Koh Samui flies almost exclusively Bangkok Airways, but to Phuket the selection is already larger. You can get a good overview on Skyscanner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many other islands, such as Koh Phangan, Koh Mook, Koh Lipe or Koh Tao can only be reached by boat. There are many options in combination with the boat &ndash; the bus, the train or the airplane. The choice is huge. For tickets, prices, times and the various possibilities, you can search with our partner 12go.asia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Koh Mook</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with the dreamlike island of Koh Mook. It is located in the Andaman Sea on the west coast of Thailand in the region of Trang. Koh Mook and the surrounding islands such as Koh Ngai or Koh Kradan are true paradises and still not that much visited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even during our stay in the main season there weren&rsquo;t too many visitors on the island. Although Koh Mook doesn&rsquo;t have any nightlife or parties to speak of, it offers you peace, remoteness and wonderful dreamlike beaches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Chicken Island (Koh Gai)</p><p>Chicken Island or Koh Gai, as it is called in Thai, is located off the coast of Ao Nang in Krabi. There are no accommodations on the island, but you can visit Chicken Island on a nice day trip from Ao Nang.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can reach the island either by one of the island hopping tours or go there on your own with one of the longtail boats at the beach of Ao Nang. It&rsquo;s totally worth a visit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Koh Phayam</p><p>Koh Phayam is located in the Andaman Sea on Thailand&rsquo;s west coast near the town of Ranong. The island is becoming more and more popular, however at the moment there is still very little tourism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the fact that the island is pretty quiet, you can still do a lot during your stay. You can visit the pier temple, the beautiful and secluded beaches, go with a kayak through the mangroves or do an island hopping tour to the surrounding islands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Koh Samui</p><p>Koh Samui is the third largest island of Thailand and next to Phuket the most popular amongst tourists. It attracts many vacationers every year and has quite a lot to offer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the &ldquo;Coconut Island&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s how Samui is sometimes called) you can find many beautiful beaches, impressive temples, large shopping malls, night markets and a diverse range of restaurants, bars and clubs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On Koh Samui there is always something going on, but there are still some quiet places if you are more into that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. Koh Phangan</p><p>Koh Phangan is especially famous for its monthly Full Moon Party and located only 30 minutes by boat from Koh Samui. Many visitors just come to the island for this very event. But Koh Phangan has actually quite a lot more to offer!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Three weeks a month, when the Full Moon Party isn&rsquo;t happening, Koh Phangan is a relaxed and quiet island. There is a lot to discover so you won&rsquo;t be bored for sure. The sights range from temples and waterfalls to hiking the Khao Ra, which is the highest mountain of the island.</p>', '2019-05-06 17:25:35', NULL, 24, 11),

Although Christmas is celebrated in Russia according to the Orthodox calendar, you&#38;rsquo;ll still find Christmas decorations set up in December in time for Christmas in Western Europe. &#38;nbsp; These decoration will be up through January, which is when Orthodox Christmas occurs. Russia has a unique history in terms of Christmas as it was banned during the Soviet period.&#38;nbsp; Officials tried to combine Christmas into New Year&#38;rsquo;s Eve, which is a popular family holiday in Russia today.&#38;nbsp; However, in post-Soviet Russia, Christmas is a big deal.&#38;nbsp; Many tourists come to Moscow as well as other Russian cities to enjoy the festive atmosphere, shop, and take selfies.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You&#38;rsquo;ll find Christmas decorations as well as smaller markets all throughout the city.&#38;nbsp; Each neighborhood typically has a tree as well as some kind of festivities, however the most popular area to visit is along Tverskaya Street.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you&#38;rsquo;re planning on visiting Moscow for Christmas, be sure to book your hotel room in Moscow early as this is a popular travel time for Russians.&#38;nbsp; We waited to book our room until we got the visa documents together&#38;nbsp; and ended up paying a premium compared to when we first checked prices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You might be required to have your accommodations booked in order to request a visa.&#38;nbsp; Some hotels will assist you in getting an invitation letter, if required, for an additional fee.&#38;nbsp; We stayed at Legendary Historical Hotel Sovietsky, a grand Soviet-era hotel that offered visa assistance.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Not surprisingly, it was chilly in Moscow during Christmas, however the crowds were intense enough that I ended up partially unzipping my jacket!&#38;nbsp; If you&#38;rsquo;ll just be enjoying the city center of Moscow, a good pair of boots (or booties) for walking around, a winter jacket, pants (possibly with tight underneath for added warmth), gloves, a hat, and a scarf.&#38;nbsp; I ended up layering up with a sweater and a t-shirt underneath my jacket. &#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;u&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Avoiding the crowds during Christmas in Moscow&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/u&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The period between New Year&#38;rsquo;s Eve and Orthodox Christmas is one of the busiest times for Moscow.&#38;nbsp; Many Russians will come to the city center to enjoy the spectacular lights and shop. &#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Avoiding the crowds will prove more difficult than you imagine.&#38;nbsp; We attempted to go to the Red Square a few times, but ended up being frustrated with the crowds.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;u&#62;&#60;strong&#62;The Red Square Christmas Market&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/u&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Red Square Christmas market has beautifully decorated stalls, multiple selfie spots, children&#38;rsquo;s rides, and enough stalls to purchase some unique gifts.&#38;nbsp; It took us about 1-2 hours to browse the market.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;I was a bit put off by how crowded the Red Square Christmas was.&#38;nbsp; It was a bit chaotic and claustrophobic, however it was definitely worth viewing.&#38;nbsp; I recommend avoiding wearing backpacks and ensuring that your bag is zips securely as we were warned about pickpockets.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Like Christmas markets elsewhere, you&#38;rsquo;ll find numerous drinks, including glintwine. Glintwine is the Russian equivalent of gluhwein, a delicious mulled wine made with cloves and oranges.&#38;nbsp; You&#38;rsquo;ll also find lots of tea in giant samovars, a great treat during the winter months in Moscow.&#38;nbsp; Additionally, you&#38;rsquo;ll find cookies as well as food stands serving typical foods, such as Georgian-style meats.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;u&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Souvenirs worth getting from the Christmas Market&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/u&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Birch is a typical wood from Russia and it is credited for keeping the Soviet army alive during World War II.&#38;nbsp; (Its bark can be burned for warmth!) You&#38;rsquo;ll find numerous stalls selling birch souvenirs, including containers for coffee.&#38;nbsp; I paid about 7 euros for my birch coffee container.&#38;nbsp; You&#38;rsquo;ll also find the famous matryoshka dolls, which originate in Sergiev Posad, a great souvenir from Russia.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;', '2019-05-07 20:44:22', NULL, 25, 12),
(14, '10 Ways to Explore the Magical Daintree Rainforest', '<p>In the morning, I&rsquo;m dipping into turquoise water holes, canopied by one of the most diverse and oldest rainforests on the planet. In the afternoon, I&rsquo;m snorkelling through a vibrant underwater playground that is part of the world&rsquo;s biggest single structure of living organisms. The Daintree rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef nestled in the lush region of Tropical North Queensland, and this just happens to be the only place on earth where two spectacular world-heritage areas meet. I recently spent four days exploring this stunning region and found there was so much to see and do within this one space!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Here is a list of many&nbsp;different ways you can explore the magical Daintree rainforest:</u></p><p>To kick start your adventures, taking a cruise along the Daintree River is the quickest way of getting up close and personal with the local wildlife. On the boat ride, you&rsquo;ll learn about the Daintree eco-system from a local guide, whilst spotting an array of birds, snakes, and of course, crocodiles! We got rather lucky on our tour- just minutes into it we had spotted our first little croc, and before long, our boat was parked up next to &lsquo;Scarface&rsquo;, the daddy of all crocs! In case you were wondering, everyone came back from the cruise alive and with all limbs intact.</p><p>Nestled into an idyllic rainforest setting, the Julaymba Restaurant at the Daintree Ecolodge is a treat for the eyes and the taste buds. Julaymba offers a unique outdoor dining experience, surrounded by a canopy of trees and the soothing sound of birds overhead. The restaurant serves up beautiful dishes inspired by local Australian ingredients, with offerings such as king prawn linguine, coral trout with caramelized pineapple and a delectable wattle seed mousse.</p><p>It&rsquo;s one thing walking through the Daintree Rainforest, but you can take the experience to whole new level by zip lining over the top of it! Jungle Surfing is a guided tour through the Daintree canopy in the form of six different zip lines. For the thrill-seekers- don&rsquo;t set your expectations too high, each zip line is fairly tame. Whilst jungle surfing might not fulfill your need for speed, it&rsquo;s still a cool way to learn about the ecosystem of the rainforest in a unique and slightly thrilling way!</p><p>Freeride Electric Adventure Tours offer the unique opportunity to explore around the Daintree Rainforest on electric bikes.&nbsp; These bikes basically allow you to fly up hills and glide through lush greenery without breaking a real sweat, and are a completely eco-friendly way of exploring the rainforest. During the tour, our guide took us through a stunning section of the Daintree, filled with birds and wildlife, and showed us to a completely untouched waterhole for a swim. I didn&rsquo;t expect to enjoy riding an electric bike so much- but it was a really fun way of exploring the rainforest (whilst feeling like Lance Armstrong)!</p><p>Galloping down the beach on a noble steed- could there be a better way to appreciate the beauty of Cape Tribulation? Ride through picturesque paddocks with a wonderful back-drop of mountains, trotting along a winding river bed before emerging at the idyllic Myall Beach, which was named one of the best beaches in Australia. The highlight of the tour was splashing through the crystal clear waters of this stunning part of the ocean on our horses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>', '2019-05-07 21:09:11', NULL, 26, 13),

After arriving at Yosemite National Park, I&nbsp;thought I had died and gone to nature-lover&rsquo;s heaven. My ideal was now right in front of my eyes, in all its luscious, sunshine-filled glory.</p><p>Growing up in Australia, going for a walk normally meant a hike through dense, dry bushland, cautiously avoiding long grass and the slithering creatures that lay in the midst. It was very refreshing to experience nature in an entirely new way. The only potential threat in this&nbsp;National Park are its black bears, and I totally wouldn&rsquo;t have minded coming face to face with one of those cuddly creatures. At least&nbsp;until it clawed my face off. &nbsp;Unfortunately (or rather&nbsp;fortunately), the only creatures I came into contact with were the adorable squirrels that scurried&nbsp;around the forest, pausing to pose for photos and scavenge for food. You know you are from Australia when you still get excited about the sighting of a squirrel&hellip;</p><p>On our sojourn through Yosemite, we took The Mist Trail up to the top of Vernal Falls, which was an absolute stunner of a hike. The trail is a <strong>4.8km round-trip</strong> and takes about 2 hours to complete, depending on your pace. For a longer hike, you can continue on the track up to Nevada Falls, which is an 11km round-trip. I would definitely suggest doing the longer trail if you have the time. If the first section is anything to go by, I think the rest of the track would be equally as amazing.</p><p>The Mist Trail doesn&rsquo;t get its name for no reason- you will probably end up a little damp by the end of the trail from all that mist cascading off the waterfall. But don&rsquo;t let that dampen your spirits, the hike is definitely worth a little shower along the way&hellip; In fact, its quite a welcome spritz if you are doing the hike in summer! The hike isn&rsquo;t extremely strenuous, but there is incline of 300 meters and a lot of stairs to compete with so I suggest coming equipped with proper walking shoes (learn from my mistakes).</p><p>&nbsp;Yosemite National Park really was a dream, and I will definitely be back to explore its phenomenal beauty even further.

The stereotype is accurate, but Rio is also a city on the edge. Multiple edges, actually: Its richest live on the edge of iconic beaches. Its poorest live on the edge of the richest in vertical favelas they call comunidades. And because of rising crime rates, everyone lives on the edge of joie-de-vivre and fear of violence.*</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>When to Go</strong></u></p><p>High season is the southern summer, more precisely Christmas to Ash Wednesday (aka the day after Carnaval). This is Rio boiled down to its essence, with the stress on &ldquo;boiled&rdquo;&mdash;average highs hover around 90. Beaches are at capacity, except on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, when the fireworks over Copacabana fill the beach far beyond capacity, attracting millions. May to September is calmer, cheaper, and far more pleasant&mdash;it even rains less&mdash;but beach days are somewhat less common.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>Celebrate</strong></u></p><p>There could hardly be a more famous event&mdash;or an event more worthy of fame&mdash;than Rio&rsquo;s multifaceted Carnaval celebration. It&#39;s officially a five-day weekend culminating on Fat Tuesday, but in reality it&#39;s a summer-long crescendo leading to that weekend, with its five nights of extravagant samba school performances at the Sambadrome Marqu&ecirc;s de Sapuca&iacute; and the let-it-all-hang-out, beer-fueled bacchanal of street parties called blocos. As an alternative, the biannual Rock in Rio festival will be back in 2019.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>What to Eat</strong></u></p><p>Saturday afternoon is the official time to gorge on feijoada, the black bean and pork stew that has become Brazil&rsquo;s national dish. But nothing could say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Carioca&rdquo; more than ordering a bowl (a tigela) of a&ccedil;a&iacute;. The sweetened, sorbet-like incarnation of the antioxidant-packed Amazonian fruit that has swept the world is never better than when ordered with granola and sliced banana and eaten standing at a corner juice bar in the city where &ldquo;a&ccedil;a&iacute; na tigela&rdquo; was invented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>Souvenir to Take Home</strong></u></p><p>Brazil is much more than Rio, and you can get a sense of the vastness and diversity of its artistic traditions at CRAB, a Portuguese abbreviation for the Sebrae Reference Center for Brazilian Handicrafts. It&rsquo;s part gallery, with intriguing exhibitions, and part tempting gift shop, which sells items by many of the same artists and artisans whose work you&rsquo;ll see on display.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>Sustainable Travel Tip</strong></u></p><p>Rio de Janeiro has a popular bike-sharing system and plenty of ciclovias&mdash;dedicated bike lanes&mdash;on which to use them, covering most of the territory visitors are likely to traverse. And it couldn&rsquo;t be cheaper: about $3 a month.

Number 7 is a must-do for any visitor!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;1.) Masaki Sushi&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Honestly, I think Niagara-on-the-Lake is a pretty lucky town to have the owners of Masaki Sushi that make some of the tastiest sushi this side of Ontario! It&#38;rsquo;s easily one of the very best restaurants in Niagara-on-the-Lake, that&#38;rsquo;s for sure.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Make sure to try their Aburi Sushi that&#38;rsquo;s made from Seared Nigiri, their spicy salmon rolls all washed down with enough sake to get you pickled! Their Mio Sparkling Sake is so nice.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;2.) Treadwell&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Based on Queen Street, right in the heart of Niagara-on-the-Lake is Treadwell, one of my favourite restaurants in the town. It&#38;rsquo;s a proper farm-to-table style establishment and they pride themselves on having the best seasonal, freshest and local foods (and wines) for us all to enjoy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Make sure to try their seared scallops and capers for starters, I could have eaten this over and over again!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;3.) The Winery Restaurant at Peller Estates&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;So, the Winery Restaurant is easily a contender to be one of the best restaurants in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Perched just out of the town itself, on the Peller Estate, they have the most amazing menu of things like; pistachio crusted goats cheese and Rainbow trout (which you&#38;rsquo;ll find a lot of around this region).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When you&#38;rsquo;re here, make sure you try some of the wines from the estate, too. They&#38;rsquo;re delicious.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;4.) Gelato di Carlotta&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you&#38;rsquo;ve got a craving for something sweet, Gelato di Carlotta is the place to go. Honestly, it&#38;rsquo;s a contender for one of the best ice creams I&#38;rsquo;ve had outside of Italy! This is a family-run joint and you can tell they really care for the gelato they serve.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Their chocolate orange, peanut and even pumpkin ice creams. They&#38;rsquo;re delicious&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;5.) Backhouse&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Backhouse is a really cool (and totally tasty) restaurant that&#38;rsquo;s actually quite unassuming from the outside but their food is amazing. Although prices are a little higher than your run-of-the-mill joint, it&#38;rsquo;s well worth it for the care and attention they put into their meals.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;They&#38;rsquo;re considered a renaissance restaurant that sources as much as they can from their very own gardens each and every day, whilst other items are sourced as locally as possible.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Make sure to try their ack of spring lamb (with plenty of artichokes) and their Icewine float.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;6.) The Olde Angel Inn&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This is almost home-away-from-home for us Brits! The Olde Angel Inn actually feels like a British Pub once you step inside! It&#38;rsquo;s a proper, informal and pretty busy joint where you can rock up, grab a pint and have some bangers and mash with lashings of onion gravy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It&#38;rsquo;s the perfect local pub for your trip to Niagara-on-the-Lake.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;7.) Prince of Wales, Drawing Room&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;So, if you really wanna lean into the British heritage of Niagara-on-the-Lake, stop off at the Prince of Wales Drawing Room for a spot of afternoon tea. For those unfamiliar, this usually consists of lashings of tea (about 20 varieties), spongey cakes, scones and some good old cucumber sandwiches.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Prices can be a little higher than the average for a lunch but it&#38;rsquo;s perfect for a treat.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;8.) Bistro Six-One&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Bistro Six-One is one of those informal spots you go to for their wood-fired pizzas. It&#38;rsquo;s one of the town&#38;rsquo;s more relaxed restaurants which is actually quite nice when you&#38;rsquo;re justing wanting to chill with some comfort food.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Fill up on carbs, grab one of their freshly baked pizzas (with extra cheese) and call it a night.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Oh yeah, and that&#38;rsquo;s me trying to hide my plate of fries that I ordered WITH a pizza. Yup, I&#38;rsquo;m THAT (greedy) guy!&#60;/p&#62;', '2019-05-07 21:53:03', NULL, 30, 17);
